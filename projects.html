            <b>Remote Data Integrity: (JSP, JDBC, JavaScript, Html, CSS, Java, Oracle, Apache Tomcat)  </b> 
            This project helps the client to store the data securely in Cloud using third party auditor and primary key generator.  Apache Tomcat is used to integrated with other technologies, such as databases, messaging systems, 
            and caching solutions, to create complex and powerful web applications. Used Html and CSS along with bootstrap for the application front-end part.

            <b>A server without a server: (Amazon Services)  </b>
            Using serverless cloud computing architecture will allow you to deploy products more quickly and efficiently. In addition, serverless websites provide several benefits, including scalability, the ability to charge users 
            depending on their use of serverless environments such as DynamoDB, API, S3, and consumption. Used AWS Lambda as serverless computes either behind APIs or to react to asynchronous events.</p>
